Though considered an arcane art, Alchemy does not require the
practitioner to directly tap into the flow of mana in the world. Instead,
through careful blending of reagents, the alchemist creates powerful
elixirs that generate magical effects through their own power. Elixirs
mimic spells through a combination of aetherstone and potent reagents,
and anyone can consume an elixir to experience its effects.
Creating elixirs can be as simple as crushing the necessary reagents
together or as complicated as distilling and rectifying them to form a
purified admixture. In roleplaying terms, the time a player spends on
creating an elixir is up to them to decide. As many mixtures may be
created as a player has the necessary reagents for, though each different
type of mixture should be prepared separately.
Even once an alchemist has reagents in hand, it requires skill and some
fundamental appreciation of magic to work them into a desired elixir.
Alchemists are classed based on the highest potency that they can work
with; the novice is limited to mixing common reagents, the adept can
add in lesser reagents, but it is the expert that knows how to blend
greater reagents with the others to form the most potent of elixirs.
The use of elixirs is up to the user, though the alchemist may provide
input as to how it is meant to be taken. Their effect is almost immediate
upon the user, unless noted otherwise. Elixirs mimic spells through a
combination of aetherstone and reagents, and anyone can consume an
elixir to experience its effects. If someone consumes 3 or more elixirs
over the course of a Watch, they begin to suffer from Aether Sickness.
It is recommended that each elixir be tagged with a label describing
what the effect it has is hidden on it. Elixirs that are consumed take
effect immediately. Any Elixir applied to a weapon (a Poison) or placed
in food or drink has its effect occur 1 minute after a successful strike (as
per the POISON call).
