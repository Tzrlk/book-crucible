As much a part of the world as the four material elements of air, earth,
fire and water, the fifth element of aether, known commonly as magic,
exists in the world as a combination of the ten aetheric winds; Death,
Life, Fate, Forces, Matter, Mind, Prime, Space, Spirit, and Time.
From an understanding of the aetheric winds there have arisen
seven colleges of magic: Conjuration, Divination, Evocation,
Illusion, Necromancy, Restoration, and Transmutation. Each draws
predominantly on one of the aetheric winds in particular, along
with aspects of the others. Of the ten winds, Prime does not have its
own college as its raw power is to be found across all magic; Time is
intertwined with Fate; and Spirit neither as it is the domain of entities
not of this world.
Five special practices of spellcasting also are known to exist: High
Magic, Shamanism, Sorcery, Enchanting, and Alchemy, though some
mages debate the former at great length. It should be noted that the
special practices of High Magic, Shamanism, and Sorcery are mutually
exclusive; a Sorcerer cannot be a High Mage, nor a Shaman a Sorcerer
for example.
Every mage’s casting of spells is powered by internal reserves of arcane
power, known as Mana. This mana is drawn from the surrounding
environment, and naturally replenishes at the break of dawn and dusk
when the aetheric winds settle most upon the world. Units of mana are
measured in arcans. The more powerful the spell, the more mana is
required. All spells cost 1 mana to cast, unless otherwise specified.
A spellcaster must by default have both hands free for spellcasting.
The exceptions to this are if they are holding an object that can fit in
their palm, a wand, or if they have a special ability that modifies this
requirement. When casting a spell, one hand should at least touch the
reagent or pouch that it is stored in for the power of the reagent to be
channelled as part of the spell. Speaking is not necessarily required
for spellcasting, and mute spellcaster can still cast using calls unless
otherwise noted.
Cantrips are first level spells that if a spellcaster possesses at least 3 noncantrip
spells in that College, are free in terms of Gnosis Point cost. Any
Gnosis Points already spent to obtain these cantrips are refunded.
College of Conjuration
Associated with summoners and hedge wizards, the
College of Conjuration is empowered by the Wind of
Space. In addition to granting the user the power to
translocate, it also can bring or banish other creatures
or entities to the caster at their whim, and grants the highly desired
ability to dispel lingering magical effects.
