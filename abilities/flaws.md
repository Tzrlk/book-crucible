A character may possess up to two flaws, which may be selected only
at character creation. Possession of a flaw grants additional trait points,
or advantages (and disadvantages) that cannot be acquired through
other means. These are expected to be acted out during the course of
gameplay.
Elder
A lifetime of experience has taught you much (+8 XP), but you are
now not as sprightly or resilient as you once were. Your HP is reduced
by 1 and your Dying time is only ever 2 minutes at the most. You are
expected to act appropriately for your age, as excessive stress may bring
about ‘undesirable’ outcomes at the discretion of the GMs team.
Dumb as an Ox
You possess +1 Power, though cannot resist any Mental Effects. You are
also illiterate. You start with only Wits x 2 in GP and gain only your Wits
score in GP each Chapter. You cannot take any ability to increase GP.
Sensitive Hulk
You possess +1 Fortitude, though FEAR effects always last at least until
the end of the Encounter.
Too Smart to Die
You possess +1 Wits, though as soon as you take a point of damage (to
HP or AP) you cannot attack or cast magic that targets others, only
defend youself. Lasts until the end of the Encounter.
Delicate Physique
You possess +1 Finesse, but each time you take a point of damage you
are CRIPPLED in the limb that is hit (ignore this effect if you are hit on
the same limb multiple times).
Unburdened Morality
You possess +1 Will, but you are Soulless.
The Voices in my Head
You can never gain a benefit from abilities, spells or items that would
otherwise allow you to RESIST the effects of a CHARM or DOMINATE
call, but any CHARM and DOMINATE effects only ever last for 1
minute at the most.
Perpetual Student
You cannot cast 3rd circle spells or create expert elixirs. In addition, if
you take part in any group Ritual Cast, you do not contribute toward the
drawing of additional tokens. Your lengthy tutelage means that spells
and elixirs cost 1 less GP to learn (to a minimum of 1). You cannot also
possess ‘Spellbook Scholar’.
Spellbook Scholar
To cast any spell more powerful than a cantrip, you must refer to a
spellbook. Your studious practice though means that the cost to learn
any spell is reduced by 1 Gnosis Point (to a minimum of 1). You cannot
also possess ‘Perpetual Student’.
Necrophobia
Though well versed in the ways of the world (+3 XP), you are terrified
when faced with the Undead. When faced with one (or more) you
cannot advance, only retreat.
Daemonophobia
Though well versed in the ways of the world (+3 XP), you are terrified
when faced with Demons. When faced with one (or more) you cannot
advance, only retreat.
Agrizoophobia
Though well versed in the ways of the world (+3 XP), you are terrified
when faced with Bestials. When faced with one (or more) you cannot
advance, only retreat.
Crippled by the Gods
A past adventure left you with profound experience (+4 XP), but
permanently crippled one of your limbs or left you blind. Try as you
might, you cannot be healed mundanely or magically of this injury.
Grizzled Addict
A hard life has given you much experience (+4 XP), but you must
consume a chosen drug for at least two out of the four Watches per
Day, otherwise until you consume it and for at least the remainder of
the Watch afterwards, you fall under the effect of a major derangement
linked to the addiction.
Daimon
You have made a particularly horrid
pact with an aetheric entity for its
favour. In exchange for 3 wishes
provided by the entity, your soul is
pledged to them and an uncertain fate
awaits you after death. In addition,
if you possess and use a Fate Bag
for spellcasting, you must add and
additional 3 black tokens to your Fate
Bag, bringing the total to 12 black
and 1 white token. Every time you
fail a Fate Bag draw when involved
in casting a spell, make a note of this.
When you have accumulated 8 such
failures, report to the GMs.
Fortunate Fool
You always start a Chapter game without any currency, only equipment
that you previously possessed, though items of significance have a habit
of turning up in your possession.
Arcane Savant
The Gnosis Point cost to learn any spell or enchanted artefact schematic
is reduced by 1, though all spells that you cast must be done as rituals.
I am Invincible
You are blighted with a form of incurable leprosy and though Immune
to AGONY, cannot feel when you are bleeding or damaged and each
time you take a point of damage you count as having acquired the
BLEED effect.
Power flows through you
When you wear physical armour you become unable to cast any spells
for the rest of the Watch, but you can regain 2 mana 1/Encounter if you
meditate for at least 5 minutes.
13
Touched by the Wildlings
You can see Invisible things, but whenever you are under the effect of a
spell of any duration, you count as being CONFUSED.
Touch of Death
You possess the ability to inflict 1 damage every 10 seconds to a touched
target. You cannot however, possess any level of Physician, cannot brew
healing potions, and healing spells you cast restore one fewer HP than
normal.
Aether Shadow
You cannot cast spells or gain benefit from magic that is cast on you or
from elixirs that you consume. You are also completely unaffected by
mutagens. The up-side is that any effects delivered via spell packets or
point attacks only last 10 seconds, unless they deal damage or an instant
effect (like CRIPPLE or LETHAL), in which case you are affected as
normal.
Terminal Fate
Death follows in your footsteps (+5 XP), and each time you take a point
of damage you need to receive medical stabilisation or at the End of
Encounter you count as Dying.
Marked for Death
Damned by the gods, got on the wrong side of the assassins guild, and
betrayed a vengeful ex-lover, et cetera, et cetera (+10 XP). Either way,
you are doomed. NPC crew will be made aware that you are ‘Marked
for Death’ and are at liberty to promptly kill you if given the chance.
This is not a flaw for the faint-hearted. You cannot also possess ‘Special
Snowflake’ or ‘The Darkest Past’.
Special Snowflake
You’re the one true hero of this
Chronicle, the offspring of a god,
and champion of the downtrodden,
et cetera, et cetera (+6 XP).
Whatever the reason, everything
seems to revolve around you.
NPC crew will be made aware that
you are a ‘Special Snowflake’ and
are at liberty to come to you and
mercilessly beg your assistance for
the most inane of troubles. There
will be little respite. This is not
a flaw for the faint-hearted. You
cannot also possess ‘The Darkest
Past’ or ‘Marked for Death’.
The Darkest Past
Tragically, your family have all been murdered, your lover left you at the
altar, and your lands have been completely overrun by tuskjaws with you
as the last survivor, et cetera, et cetera (+6 XP). Nobody has a darker past
than you. NPC crew will be made aware that you have ‘The Darkest Past’
and are at liberty to inundate you with angst whenever appropriate, and
you are never immune to Night Watch encounters. Your sleeping place
must be reported to the GMs at the start of a Chapter game, and you
should expect to be disturbed while you attempt to sleep. This is not a
flaw for the faint-hearted. You cannot also possess ‘Special Snowflake’ or
‘Marked for Death’.
GM Note: In building a character, you should not take any of these last
three flaws because your character is a hero or they have a dark past. These
are flaws meant to allow participants to create characters that will in all
likelihood only last a short while, as the unbridled force of the GMs and
crew bear down on the player. This does not mean that you get special
personal plot or anything actually positive out of these flaws, but hey, the
additional XP is something, right?
