duration less than an encounter, you can choose to double or halve that
duration. If there is an area that is affected by the spell, you can double
or halve that area. You may however, only do two of these modifications
at once. You can also cast 1st circle spells without the need for reagents.
Shaman XP Cost: 4 (Adept)
Prerequisites: Novice Spellcaster, cannot possess Sorcerer or High Mage
At a Place of Power you can affect up to your
Will in additional targets when casting a
spell through Ritual Spellcasting (i.e. Will 3
you to affect up to 4 targets with a spell).
Spells that are cast through Ritual
Spellcasting can be held until a later point
(end of the Watch at the latest) for use
by imbuing their effect into a fetish. A
Shaman can hold up to 3 spells for later
in this manner. The fetish should ideally
incorporate a description of the spell effect
imbued into it, so as to inform the eventual
target about what the effect specifically is.
At a Place or Power, a Shaman can lead a group Ritual Cast (regardless
of the specific spell) to cast a 2nd or 3rd circle spell with a chance of
not needing to expend the necessary reagents, though they must have
still have it in their possession at the time. For a 2nd circle spell at least
2 additional mages are required, and each person pays 1 mana. At the
conclusion of the casting the Shaman must draw from a Fate Bag a
number of tokens equivalent to the number of mages taking part in the
ritual (to a maximum of 5 tokens). For a 3rd circle spell the process is
the same, but the minimum number of additional mages is 5, the mana
cost to each mage is 2, and only 1 token for every 2 mages is drawn
(to a maximum of 5 tokens). If the white token is drawn the spell is
successful, and the reagent is not expended, if not, the spell is still cast
but the reagent is used up. A Shaman may only attempt one 3rd circle
spell in this way per Watch. Note that the Resurrection spell can never
be cast without the use of its necessary reagents.
Sorcerer XP Cost: 4 (Adept)
Prerequisites: Novice Spellcaster, cannot possess Shaman or High Mage
A sorcerer can call DRAIN 1/Encounter on a wounded or dying target
to obtain 2 Mana, inflicting a point of damage in the process, and in
the case of a stabilised character at 0 Health, putting them back into a
DYING state.
A sorcerer can also substitute human body parts for 3
adept and 3 expert reagents that they have specified.
These are the Eyes, Liver, and Tongue for the adept
reagents, and the Brain, Heart, and Lungs for the
Expert reagents. Before any spell is cast with such
a reagent, 6 tokens must be drawn from a Fate Bag
for a second circle spell, or 4 tokens for a third circle
spell, with a white token indicating success. If the
white token is not drawn, the spells effect backfires
on the caster, and they should interpret the effect in
an obviously negative manner for the caster.
