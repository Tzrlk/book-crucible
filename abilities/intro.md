# Abilities

## Time Periods

Abilities, calls and other aspects of the game often have times associated with them. These include:

**Encounter** - This is a narratively appropriate period of time as in a movie or television scene, roughly approximate to 20 minutes if there are no appropriate cues. Examples include a combat until the foes are vanquished or leave the field and no chase is given, or trial of a murderer until the final judgement has been given.

**Watch** - A day is divided into 4 watches, 7am-1pm, 1pm-7pm, 7pm-1am, and 1am-7am.

**Day** - A day time period is from 7am tile 7am the next day.

**Chapter** - This is the period from the start of a weekend Chapter game to the start of the subsequent weekend Chapter game.
