ABILITIES
These are skills and advantages that characters may possess that enhance what they
can do. Each ability has its own XP cost, and the acquisition of new abilities occurs
during the Downtime.
All characters by default start with the abilities of Weaponry, Novice Armour Fitness,
Novice Shield, Novice Physician, and Literate for free. Like Path abilities, if the
character does not possess the necessary prerequisites, they still possess the ability,
but cannot use it until they meet the prerequisites.
CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
Experience Points (XP) - Used to build a character and add additional abilities to
their repertoire, XP is allocated to the participant rather than a specific character. It
is earned by players and crew in equal measure, and will persist over the course of the
Chronicle. On top of the 30 XP a participant starts the Chronicle with, additional XP
can be gained through possession of select Flaws, and through ongoing attendance
at Chronicle events.
A participant will gain 5 XP per Chapter Game and 2 XP for participating in one or more day games within a Chapter.
Gnosis Points (GP) - Representing knowledge of the arcane and knowledge of the world, GP can be used to acquire spells, alchemical formulae, and
other special knowledge. It is also used to imbue enchanted artefacts. All characters by default start with their Wits x 5 in GP, and gain their Wits x
2 in GP each Chapter.
Equipment Points (EP) - Representing generic material in the game environment, EP can be obtained primarily through looting. EP can be traded
for currency in-game, or used in the downtime for equipment or the construction of faction structures.
Currency (ss) - A character will start the game with 1,000 sunshards (ss) of currency to spend on particular pieces of equipment and special items,
and will earn at least 100ss each Chapter. For more details on currency and equipment, please read the Equipment chapter of this guide.
Updates to characters are handled during the downtime through the shared Google character document, or by sending an updated character
document via email that is the complete text with any changes since the last version highlighted (if added) or struck-out (if removed).
DOWNTIME
Between each Chapter game there are 2 downtime phases. In each of these phases a player participant has the option of carrying out up to 3 actions
to hopefully improve the position of their faction and their own character. For those that do not choose to submit such actions, the default action is
Labouring at the location of the Faction Base.
Exploration - The character explores a section of the island in an active manner, hoping to find foes, treasure or mysteries.
Patrolling - The character defends a section of the island in a passive manner, guarding it against hostile intent and strengthening the faction.
Labouring - The character puts their skills to use harvesting and/or processing resources for the benefit of their faction.
Each part of the island will have a risk level that may change over the course of the Chronicle. Carrying
out an action in a part of the island will mean that a random roll is made by the Gamemaster team to
determine the outcome of the action. To determine success or failure, the traits and abilities possessed by
each character provide a hidden cumulative Combat Prowess, Arcane Prowess and Skillful Prowess. These
scores are compared to the outcome of the roll, and success, failure or an effective tie will each deliver
different outcomes.
The outcome of an action will be conveyed to a player in a simple format that indicates the nature of the
encounter, and the benefits or drawbacks that came out of it. The specific nature of the encounter will be up
to the player to determine, and should be taken as an opportunity for personal story development.
Note that in situations where multiple characters from the same faction carry out an action in the same part
of the island, Prowess bonuses will be added to the players’ scores, improving each other player’s outcomes.
FACTION COMMAND
Each of the player factions will have an overall Faction Commander who is expected to lead their forces in their expedition. This role is one that is
not tied to XP, and will need to be maintained by roleplaying. With the exception of the Hounds, each Faction Commander has the ability during
the Downtime to carry out special actions using the NPC resources of their faction.
Each of the four functions below can be held on to or delegated by the Faction Commander to other players.
Warmaster The Faction Commander or delegate can deploy NPC troops to locations to Guard, Assault, or Capture territory. Player characters
carrying out actions in parts of the island to which troops are sent will have a significant effect on the performance of the troops.
Spymaster The Faction Commander or delegate gains additional information on events within their faction and on the island during the
Downtime.
Governor The Faction Commander or delegate can devote Faction Resources to the development of the Faction Stronghold or territories.
Paymaster The Faction Commander or delegate is in charge of the Faction Treasury. This includes arranging and paying Faction members
to complete tasks, sourcing income, arranging and issuing loans to Faction businesses, and if the Faction does so, paying Faction
members a weekly stipend.
More information on Faction Command and the various abilities can be found later in this document in the Downtime section.
Time Periods
Abilities, calls and other aspects of the game often have times
associated with them. These include:
Encounter: This is a narratively appropriate period of time as in
a movie or television scene, roughly approximate to 20 minutes if
there are no appropriate cues. Examples include a combat until the
foes are vanquished or leave the field and no chase is given, or trial
of a murderer until the final judgement has been given.
Watch: A day is divided into 4 watches, 7am-1pm, 1pm-7pm, 7pm-
1am, and 1am-7am.
Day: A day time period is from 7am tile 7am the next day.
Chapter: This is the period from the start of a weekend Chapter
game to the start of the subsequent weekend Chapter game.
HIDDEN ABILITIES
In addition to the abilities and flaws listed in this section, there are
additional ones present in the Chronicle that may become apparent to
participants as the storyline progresses.
