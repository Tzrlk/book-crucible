# Concepts and States of Being

This section illustrates gameplay elements that we intend to include in
the Crucible Chronicle, along with details around the various states of
being that a character can find themselves in.

## LIFE AND DEATH

### HEALTH

Characters can take damage equal to their Health, subsequent to any
damage inflicted on their armour. It is up to players to decide how they
want to roleplay increasing amounts of damage they have taken.

Once a character is reduced to 0 health they are incapacitated and fall to
the ground DYING. At 0 hp you can delay falling to the ground to take
a hit that will look dramatic, but you cannot act. If the attacker walks
away you must collapse.

Players may choose at any time to count themselves as having been
crippled, bled, blinded or having suffered other injuries for the purposes
of enhanced roleplaying.

### DYING (aka Bleeding Out)

If reduced to 0 Health through combat or other means, a character
is Dying, and has five minutes to receive Medical Stabilisation or die.

Unless specified, it is up to players to choose whether they are knocked
out or rolling around the ground in pain while Dying. While they can
take weak actions to try and crawl or hold back a weapon (ineffectually),
they cannot effectively resist action taken against them and, being
Incapacitated, are vulnerable to FINISHING BLOW.

### MEDICAL STABILISATION

Unless specifically knocked out, a character that is at 0 HP and Dying can
be treated by a Physician of Novice rank or higher with the appropriate
equipment and become Medically Stabilised, meaning the character is
no longer Dying.

A character that is on 0HP but otherwise Medically Stabilised should
refer to their treating Physician as to what sort of movement or activity
they can engage in. A character cannot stabilise themselves with the
Physician ability. A character can, however, self-administer or have used
on them an elixir or spell that restores HP. If used in this context, the
character is automatically stabilised and regains 1HP, no matter how
many HP the elixir or spell might normally have healed.

### HEALING

A character naturally regains 1 HP at the start of each Day, and regains
an additional 1 HP at the start of each Watch if they have received
treatment from a Physician of Adept rank or higher since their last
injury. If a character possesses Fortitude 3 or 4 the amount healed
increases to 2 in both cases. They can also regain HP via arcane means,
through spells, elixirs, or other such routes. In those cases the nature of
the healing should be provided in the description of the item or ability.

### INJURIES

Some special forms of damage, referred to as Injuries, include BLEED,
CRIPPLE, DISEASE, and LETHAL. These particular effects are
indefinite in nature, but can be removed through the ministrations of
a Physician of Adept rank or higher through a period of roleplayed
treatment as determined by the Physician. Injuries can also be healed
via arcane means, through spells, elixirs, or other such routes. In those
cases the nature of the healing should be provided in the description of
the item or ability.

### DEATH

If a character receives a FINISHING BLOW or ANNIHILATE, or bleeds
out after a period of Dying, then the character is dead. Short of a quick
intervention by an Expert Physician or a particular arcane means, the
character is gone. A player character who suffers this fate should report
to the Quartermaster when they are ready for the next steps.

## CONFLICT

### ATTACKS, WEAPONS

Any normal weapon attack does not require a call, and is assumed to deal
1 point of damage per strike. Note that each strike must be appropriately
dramatic and plausible - if a player strikes lightly in rapid succession the
target is justified in reducing the number of those hits that they count.

Attacks that strike the head, hands, or groin of a target are not valid and
can be ignored by the target. Some abilities grant bonus damage.

### ATTACKS, TOUCH

Some attacks can only be delivered through touching the target. The
user must be careful to do so safely and with respect, especially if such
an attack is being used in combat. Note that touch attacks against
a target’s shield affect the target if they are effects other than damage
(BLIND or KNOCKOUT for instance). Billowing cloaks and weapons
do not count.


### ATTACKS, SPELL PACKETS

Some attacks (mainly magic) require that a spell packet be thrown at
the desired target. If it hits it takes effect, if it misses it fails. Note that all
attacks that use spell packets can also be used as touch attacks without
the need for spell packets. Note that spell packets that hit a target’s shield
or weapons still affect the target if they are effects other than damage
(BLIND or KNOCKOUT for instance). Billowing cloaks never count.

### ATTACKS, POINTED

Some attacks or special abilities only require that the character point at
a target and say what the effect is. It automatically takes effect (though
it can be resisted). It can be damage, a special ability, or both. Note that
all attacks that use a pointed attack can also be used as spell packet or
touch attacks.

### ARCHERY

Arrows and Crossbow bolts inflict 3 damage if they hit a target. Skilled
shots are a generic term for special call attacks made by Adept and
Expert archers, inflicting either BLEED, CRIPPLE, KNOCKBACK, or
LETHAL, depending on which archery skills the character possesses.
An archer can choose to vary how many of each call they use.

Due to the difficulty sometimes in hearing calls over long distances, an
archer should not expect their target to hear them if too distant when
hit. If the target ignores the effect and seems genuinely oblivious, the
effect is counted as not having affected them, though the use is still
expended.

### ARMOUR

Wearing armour provides the ability to
take additional points of damage that
are removed before a character’s Health
is affected. No matter how much
armour you are wearing, you can only
possess a number of Armour Points
equivalent to the maximum allowable
by your Armour skill. Armour
Points are restored at the end of each
Encounter. The loss of Armour Points
is more representative of the wearer
becoming fatigued than actual damage
to the armour.

If a character still has Armour Points when struck by a weapon blow
with a POISON or BLEED effect, that effect is resisted. Call RESISTED.

### IMMUNITIES

Certain abilities, effects, and items grant Immunity to other effects in
game. These essentially function as the ability to indefinitely RESIST
certain other effects.

## ALTERED STATES

### AETHER SICKNESS

The use of most magic to heal wounds (two or more times during a
Watch), and the overconsumption of elixirs (three or more during
a Watch) causes a character to suffer from Aether Sickness. This
crystallisation of arcane energies in their body reduces the character’s
maximum HP by 1, which cannot be recovered except by medical
treatment from an Adept Physician or higher.

### BLIGHTED

Conveyed typically via the BLIGHT call, damage or other injuries
inflicted in this way cannot be healed by mundane or standard magical
means until the BLIGHT effect has been removed.

### CURSED

The effects of a curse vary, but if you are handed a curse card (similar
to a disease card), you have been struck by a curse. It typically has an
indefinite effect until removed, or until the conditions of the curse are
satisfied. The casting of curses involves a blend of magic and alchemy.

### DISEASED

By default, a character infected with a Disease is down 1HP and the
effect is indefinite, though they can be cured of it by medical attention
from a Physician. A source of Disease may, after calling DISEASE on a
target, provide them with a Disease Card which supercedes the default
impact with whatever is on the card. The infected character must adhere
to what is on the card, and the cure for their Disease may require specific
forms of treatment from a Physician.

A character cannot be infected by the same disease more than once at
the same time, and if infected by multiple diseases, similar effects do
not stack. If in possession of multiple cards of the same sort, an infected
character may hand up to half of their cards to another character if the
two touch, or if they are within two metres of each other for more than
a minute (this is repeated until the infected character is down to their
last card).

### INCAPACITATION

A target can be incapacitated by various means. Examples include being
affected by AGONY or DYING, or through paralysis or being tied up.
The particular cause of incapacitation will define what the character can
and cannot do in the state, though in all of them they are vulnerable to
a FINISHING BLOW.

### INCORPOREAL

An Incorporeal character can still talk and be seen, but cannot
interact or be interacted with by anything. Unless otherwise specified,
an incorporeal character that becomes corporeal cannot attack or
cast magic for 2 seconds after becoming corporeal. Characters that
are Incorporeal should wear a yellow headband to denote they are
Incorporeal. Objects that are Incorporeal should also be marked with
an obvious strip of yellow fabric. If an Incorporeal character does not
have immediate access to a yellow hedband, they can also hold one hand
across their chest to denote they are in this state.

### INVISIBLE

An Invisible character cannot be seen or heard when they speak, and
they cannot normally interact or be interacted with by anything (though
certain special abilities or effects may alter this). Characters that are
Invisible should wear a teal headband to denote they are Invisible.

Unless otherwise specified, and invisible character loses their invisibility
if they attack a target or cast magic. Objects that are Invisible should also
be marked with an obvious strip of teal fabric. If an Invisible character
does not have immediate access to a teal headband, they can also hold
both hands across their chest to denote they are in this state. Lasting
spell effects can also be marked by teal coloured paper, though unlike
people and objects this is only for the purpose of allowing those with the
ability to see the invisible to determine the effect of the spell. At night,
this effect should ideally be represented by teal (blue) glowsticks.

### SOULLESS

A creature that has lost its soul becomes
progressively deadened to the world and
to empathy for other living creatures.
They find it difficult to lie, to love, to care
about their friends and family. They will
act primarily out of self-interest, and
rarely hesitate in taking a life or destroying
something if it gets in their way.
In functional terms, a Soulless entity does
not regenerate mana at the start of each
day and cannot meditate to draw energy
at the start of each Watch, they cannot be
resurrected unless their soul is returned
to them (though they can be reanimated
as an undead), and from a roleplaying
perspective should view the world and its inhabitants with a lack of
empathy and only cold rationalism. Effects that target emotions have no
effect on someone who is Soulless.

### OFF-GUARD

For attacks and abilities that require the target to be deemed Off-
Guard, the touch or strike must land between the shoulder blades of the
target and be delivered from behind. This state is distinct from being
Incapacitated, and a character that is caught Off-Guard in an apropriate
circumstance by a FINISHING BLOW is rendered Dying rather than
instantly Dead.

### OUT-OF-CHARACTER (OOC)

This is when a player, object, or a player’s action is not part of the game.
Hand-on-head, T-sign, red headband, red cord-tie.

## MISCELLANEOUS CONCEPTS

### DERANGEMENTS

Certain peculiarities, abilities and spells etc. make reference to
derangements. These are roleplaying cues for characters afflicted with
a debilitating mental condition, and can be either minor or major, and
either temporary or permanent. Unless specified, any derangement is to
be taken as minor and temporary.

### ELIXIRS

These are alchemical concoctions with imbued magical power that
are represented by a flask filled with liquid (must be non-toxic, nonalcoholic
and harmless in case accidentally drunk, preferably water).

They are created by an alchemist through a combination of reagents, and
their effects (noted on a label attached to the flask) begin immediately.
Poison is an exception. When an elixir is prepared as a poison and
applied to a weapon, the effect is indicated by a call preceded with
POISON. Poisons take effect 1 minute after the strike has been dealt.

### ENCHANTED ARTEFACTS

These are special items that have been crafted with imbued magical
power. They typically allow the repeated use of spell-like effects, though
they are vulnerable to destruction and theft.

### EQUIPMENT POINTS

These are an abstract representation of
trinkets and general equipment acquired
by characters, useful for trading or making
into other more useful items, or can be
handed in to the Quartermaster for variable
rewards. They are typically represented by
either red glass beads or strips of red fabric.

### FATE BAG

This is a small pouch filled by default with 9 black tokens and 1 white
token. It is used by players for various spells and other tasks to determine
if they succeed, judged by whether or not they pull out the white token
over a series of draws. Certain abilities modify the contents of a player’s
Fate Bag.

The bags and their contents are technically not in-character, and
therefore cannot be taken/stolen from a player. Fate Bags and Tokens
are an OOC prop provided by the player if they require it.

### GNOSIS POINTS

These are an abstract representation of arcane learning by an individual,
and can be used to learn spells, alchemical formulae, and hidden
knowledge, and to imbue enchanted artefacts.

### LOCKS

Doors and containers within the setting
can be locked, and are represented as
such by a coloured piece of cord tied in
a simple knot or bow-tie on the latch.
A simple lock is represented by green
cord, a complex lock by orange cord,
and an arcane lock by purple cord. If
used to lock a door, the cord cannot
actually impede the opening of the door
for safety purposes.

### LOOTING

Many NPCs will carry pouches on them which can, without too much
difficulty, be looted to obtain currency, equipment point tokens, and
special item cards. For every 10 seconds of looting an Incapacitated
(or dead) target, a character can take 1 card, 1 EP, or all their currency.
Players are also vulnerable to theft and looting by some NPCs, so IC
possessions must be guarded wisely.

### MANA

This is an abstract representation of aetheric power channelled by
an individual for the purposes of casting spells. Anyone with the
‘Spellcaster’ ability has a Mana reserve normally equal to twice their
Will score. This Mana reserve is automatically replenished at the break
of dawn and dusk unless otherwise specified. The responsibility for
keeping track of Mana is up to the player, and might be done by tokens
in a pouch, hair ties around the wrists (swap them from one to another
as they are expended) or in one’s head (if the player feels they can keep
a fair track of it that way).

### MENTAL EFFECTS

Various special effects are classified under the general category of
mental effects. Truthtelling, Psychic Reprogramming, and love potions
are examples of these sorts of effects. To help denote these effects, it is
recommended casters use the “Jedi two-finger wave” or “two-fingers to
the head”.

### POISONING

In addition to using poison elixirs on weapons through the use of a
POISON call, you can also use elixirs to poison food. To do this, attach
a green sticker to plates or cups with the poison effect written on it.
Any person eating the food will be poisoned, unless they have had the
forethought to purify the drink or meal. The poison takes effect 1 minute
after the person has finished their meal. If the person eating notices the
sticker before cleansing or eating the food, the poison takes effect even
if they cleanse it or do not eat it.

### REAGENTS

Reagents are magically infused plant and creature parts that can be used
for the casting of spells and the creation of elixirs and enchanted items.
GM Note: Though in the wider setting reagents are not always necessary
for spellcasting, they are important for successful spellcasting in magically
unstable areas. The region in which the Crucible Chronicle takes place is
exactly such an area, hence reagents are required for spellcasting.

### REPAIRING ITEMS

Though armour and weapons can take a lot of wear and tear before
needing repair, good maintenance is vital to maintaining an optimum
functional capability. In the event that armour or weapons have been
affected by an ARMOUR, SHIELD, or WEAPON BREAK call, an
Armourer is required to properly fix it, and it is encouraged that they
spend at least 5 minutes roleplaying repairing the armour (ideally off
the wearer). Beyond this it is encouraged that players consider general
armour maintenance as a roleplaying opportunity, rather than a strict
requirement. For normal objects it is up to a Craftsman to roleplay the
repair of the item as they see fit, though for special items the Craftsman
is not familiar with, there might be additional work required (as directed
by GMs).

### RESOURCE HARVESTING

Plant and environmental reagents can be harvested from orange
pouches within the game area, and creature reagents from orange
pouches on creatures. They can only be obtained from these orange
pouches if the obtainer has the appropriate skill in Foraging or Hunting.
They can also be acquired from loot pouches, treasure stashes or other
sources than do not require harvesting. Each reagent is represented by
a token or prop (both count as the same). To track the use of adept and
expert level abilities and re-use the reagents tokens for future events,
collection boxes for expended reagents will be located in a few places
at the game venue. For those with the ‘Scrounger’ ability, there is the
additional benefit of collecting up empty orange reagent pouches and
other discarded game props and trading them in at the GM cabin for
additional equipment points or other rewards.

### RITUAL SPELLCASTING

Some spells require additional preparation time. 5 minutes is the default
time for a ritual spell unless otherwise specified.

### THIEVERY

While by default there is no actual stealing of items allowed in the game
(other than gold, EP, and plot items), highly treasured items may be
represented by red Cache Markers (cubes or other abstract objects), and
glyphs on them refer to specific sorts of prizes. These can be stolen and
traded on the Black Market for a large amount of gold or other valuable
objects. These can be found in the possession of NPCs, PCs or in set
locations.

To obtain items held by other players or NPCs, a thief can attach red pegs
to their target’s pouch or satchel without raising suspicion. 2 pegs must
be successfully attached, after which the character should report to an
NPC to retrieve the desired contents in the container. Other characters
can notice the actions of a thief if they see one with red peg in hand
(looking shifty) or in the process of placing a peg (actively stealing).

For specific objects that are being stolen, a thief may attach a red tie
to indicate the item has been stolen (but not actually take the physical
item).

### TRAPS

These are mechanisms generally designed to hurt and/or incapacitate
people or creatures that trigger them. A craftsman may make a physical
trap from the equipment list, and anyone may place one of these. Any
physical trap must be constructed in a safe OOC fashion. For this
purpose, no pit traps are allowed.

### WEAPON SKILLS

Important for fighters, the weapon skills in the game include the adept
and expert levels of Small Weapons, Swords, Axes, Blunt Weapons, and
Polearms, as well as all three levels of Archery.
