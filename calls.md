Game calls are simple utterances that are intended to be used to convey
an effect or mechanic quickly and simply when there is no practical
way to physically represent it. It should be noted that though these calls
exist to assist with consistency and diversity of effects, good roleplaying
should always come before mechanics, and players and crew alike
are encouraged to look for ways to improve the immersiveness of an
encounter beyond the use of mechanics such as calls.
When using calls, chaining of words should be kept to a minimum, and
the following rules should apply:
• <Modifier><Damage/Effect><Duration> is the desired order
of words in a call. This is not an absolute rule, but rather a
recommendation to improve consistency.
• One cannot do a Damage call and an Effect call at the same time.
Only Modifier calls can be chained with Damage or Effect calls.
• One cannot call two Effects at the same time.
• The default Duration for most calls is 1 minute with the exception
of the FREEZE call, and any effects that are delivered by POISON.
Any durations different to this must be called by the user.
• There ideally should be some delay between calls to help targets
process what effects they have been subjected to and how they
might react.
TWO / THREE / FOUR etc. Instant Effect
Whether through a weapon attack, a magic spell
or some other effect, damage above the default or
done in unusual circumstances should be called
by saying ‘two damage’ or ‘two’ for example.
The default is that all melee and thrown weapon
strikes do one point of damage, arrows do three
points of damage, and that spell packets do none
(although the spells they deliever may well do
additional damage).
Only calls in this list that are marked with
(Modifier) should be combined with a multiple
damage calls.
GM Note: It should be noted that there are those that prefer to use the
terms “Double” or “Triple” for instance in place of numbers. While we
would encourage participants to adopt numbers instead, these alternate
terms are also acceptable.
AGONY 1 Minute Duration
A target affected by agony is Incapacitated as their body is wracked with
immense pain. They cannot effectively focus on their surrounding or
take any action except to writhe around and perhaps lash out (without
causing damage) to those around them.
BLIGHT (Modifier) Instant Effect
If struck by a blighted blow, any damage taken that Encounter cannot
be healed by normal means until the BLIGHT effect is removed. If the
blighted attack is another form of injury (like CRIPPLE or BLIND), it
is indefinite and cannot be healed by normal means until the BLIGHT
effect of that specific injury is removed.
ANNIHILATE Instant Effect
A variant on FINISHING BLOW or DEATH that has the same effect,
but has greater ramifications for the character. The nature of this will
become apparent in the Chronicle.
ARMOUR BREAK Instant Effect
Armour is broken and cannot regenerate Armour Points until repaired.
It provides no AP while broken.
BANISH Instant Effect
Target spirit is instantly returned to its home plane. No effect on mortal
creatures.
BLAST (Modifier) Instant Effect
An attack that deals damage or an effect all targets within 5 metres of
the caster. The user should call “BLAST 3” or “BLAST PARALYSE” for
example, and perform a suitable action (such as throwing both arms out
to the side).
BLEED Injury, Indefinite Duration
This represents a wound at a critical
location that deteriorating faster than
magical healing can counteract it. Healing
spells and potions as well as Regeneration
abilities are rendered useless until medical
attention has been applied and the BLEED
effect is removed.
If a target still possesses any AP, the strike
must land on part of the target not covered
by leather or metal armour to take effect. If
it strikes armour instead it is automatically
resisted.
BLIND 1 Minute Duration
Target cannot see. Player are allowed to keep eyes open for safety
purposes, but roleplay accordingly and act as though one cannot see
anything (thousand mile stare).
CHARM Mental Effect, Watch Duration
Target believes that the source of the effect is a close and trusted friend
until the end of the Watch. They will take action to assist the source
according to their nature until the end of the effect, though they will
not take any action that directly harms themselves or one of their other
friends.
The target is not bound to follow the caster, and can always choose to
leave their presence. Any harmful act by the caster against the target
breaks the effect.
CONFUSE Mental Effect, 1 Minute Duration
Target becomes confused. If threatened (in combat or not) they will
wildly lash out with their weapons (though cannot use special abilities)
at targets around them. If unthreatened they will have difficulty
processing information (up to target to roleplay).
COUNTERSPELL Instant Effect
Hold up palm of hand and call “Counterspell” against a spell effect just
cast, where you are either near to the caster, or you are within 5 metres of
the target (or the target yourself). The spell fails to take effect completely.
No reagents are expended by the caster of the countered spell, but they
still lose the mana for the spell. They cannot attempt to cast the spell
again for 1 minute.
Note that you cannot COUNTERSPELL a COUNTERSPELL.
CRIPPLE Injury, Indefinite Duration
A limb hit by a crippling attack is rendered useless until healed. If the
torso (includes the front and back of the shoulder) is hit by such an
attack, the target gets to choose which limb is affected. Arms are unable
to hold anything heavy (like longswords or shields), and if a leg is
crippled the target is forced to move with a significant limp. If both legs
are crippled, the target collapses to the ground, though is still able to
crawl if they so choose.
GAME CALLS
15
DEATH Instant Effect
Target is instantly killed (they do not bleed out).
DISEASE Injury, Indefinite Duration
Target becomes infected with a Disease. Unless otherwise specified, this
is akin to a bad cold that reduces their HP by 1 (to a minimum of 1) and
leaves them feeling unwell.
DISINTEGRATE Instant Effect
Target is instantly turned to ash, though their spirit lingers. A
disintegrated target becomes an invisible spirit until they decide to
pass on or they are fortunate enough to be ritually reconstituted. Note:
This effect might at times be represented by the flash of a bright green
spotlight.
DOMINATE Mental Effect, Encounter Duration
Similar to Charm, but can be used against hostile targets. Target believes
that the source of the effect is a close and trusted master until the end
of the Encounter. They will take action to help and defend the source
until the end of the effect, and they can take action that directly harms
themselves (like stabbing themselves).
DRAIN Instant Effect
Target loses 1 HP, unless more is specified such
as ‘Drain 2’. Depending on the source of the
ability the user might gain those drained HP as
their own to heal or use for some other purpose.
Drain can also be called to indicate mana drain,
in which case the user would specify ‘Drain 2
Mana’.
Lastly it can represent soul drain, in which case
it is ‘Drain Soul’, rendering the target Soulless.
FEAR Mental Effect, 1 Minute Duration
Target is forced to run away and/or hide from the caster.
FREEZE 10 Second Duration
Call “Freeze” and then by default 10 seconds later “Resume” A short
time-out call for use in slowing combat down rather than stopping it
completely. All in the vicinity should stop what they are doing as though
paralysed while the caller may (depending on the source of the ability)
take some other actions during the count of the call.
FRENZY Mental Effect, 1 Minute Duration
Target goes into a frenzy and attacks the the nearest obvious threat to
them.
FINISHING BLOW Instant Effect
Also sometimes uttered as “KILLING BLOW”, this call is used by players
and NPCs alike to indicate when a target has been definitively killed.
The target must be Incapacitated and the user
must make a clearly appropriate action like
motioning cutting a head off, along with a
clear call that those in the immediate vicinity
can hear.
Characters can still die by succumbing to
their injuries or in dramatic scenes where it
is obvious they will not survive (like having
their head chopped off), and this call is
primarily meant for combat.
Note that certain monsters may require
something more than just a finishing blow to
kill them or prevent them from resurrecting.
GM Note: In certain circumstances it may be dramatically appropriate
for a character to threaten another character by holding a blade to their
throat. In most cases, if the cut is made and/or FINISHING BLOW is
called, the character should treat this as though they are now Dying.
OOC, it is recommended that for safety purposes, unless both parties are
comfortable with a different position, that a weapon used in this manner
be held across the collarbone rather than the throat. Pressure to the throat
should never be applied.
KNOCKBACK Instant Effect
Target is forced to move away at least 3 metres from source of the
KNOCKBACK effect and spend a few seconds recovering before joining
any combat again.
LETHAL Injury, Indefinite Duration
This represents a wound at a critical location that is deteriorating faster
than magical healing can counteract it. If the target is struck in the torso
(includes the front and back of the shoulder) with the effect, the target is
immediately reduced to 0 HP and is Dying. Healing spells and potions as
well as regenerative abilities are rendered useless until medical attention
has been given and the LETHAL effect is removed.
MUTE 1 Minute Duration
Target cannot speak. This does not by default stop a spellcaster from
casting their magic, and the afflicted target can still use calls to represent
the effects of their actions.
PARALYSE 1 Minute Duration
Target is frozen in place and counts as Incapacitated.
PIN Indefinite Duration
Target cannot move from the spot while the object pinning them is
against them, though they can still act. They cannot push the object
away (too heavy or it is embedded in them) and if a third party pulls it
away during combat the target takes the damage of the weapon again,
which should be called by the wielder of the pinning object.
POISON (Modifier) Injury
Poison is an effect modifier that must be
said before the actual effect it is inflicting,
such as ‘Poison Sleep’. This indicates that
the effect will not begin until 1 minute (up
to the target to track) after the call is made,
but will last until the end of the Encounter
(or it kills the target in the case of some
lethal poisons).
If a target still possesses any AP, the strike
must land on part of the target not covered
by leather or metal armour to take effect. If
it strikes armour instead it is automatically
resisted. One cannot call multiple damage
as part of a POISON attack.
GM Note: It might be useful for a user to call ‘Poison (x) in one minute’
to make it clear to the target that the effect does not strike them down
immediately.
REFLECTED Instant Effect
This is a call to let another character know that an attack, spell or special
ability that they have used on you has been turned back on them, and
should be called as REFLECT ( x ), where x is the call or damage that
was just dealt to you.
If it happened to be a spell packet ability, the character must pick up the
spell packet and immediately throw it back at the caster (and hit them)
for it to take effect, otherwise it is assumed to have just been resisted.
The REFLECT call does not work on BLAST calls, arrows/bolts, or
COUNTERSPELL calls.
RESISTED Instant Effect
This is a call made to let other characters know that an effect used on
you has been resisted and therefore you remain unaffected by their spell
or special ability. The special effect still occurs though, so if it affects
multiple people; only you are unaffected.
SHIELD BREAK Instant Effect
Shield is broken and cannot be used until repaired.
SLEEP 1 Minute Duration
Target is rendered unconscious and collapses to the ground Incapacitated.
16
SLOWED 1 Minute Duration
Target can only walk slowly, and all other actions should be exaggerated.
The target should keep one foot on the ground at all times, and can only
walk by bringing both feet together and then taking a step, bring both
feet back together and so on. Roleplay other actions slowly.
STUN 1 Minute Duration
Target is unable to focus on their surroundings, and may stagger back
from the source of the effect. They cannot actively attack, run, or perform
complex actions, though they can defend themselves if attacked.
TURN Indefinite Duration
Targets of the specified type ‘TURN UNDEAD’ for instance, must step
back from and not advance towards the source of the call for as long as it
is maintained. The source of the call should have one hand up with open
palm extended, and may repeat the call as long as the hand is still up to
ensure targets know the call is still in effect. The call is not directional,
and even targets behind the source are affected.
WEAPON BREAK Instant Effect
Weapon is broken and cannot be used until repaired.
WEAPON SPECIAL DAMAGE TYPES
A call to denote that damage being inflicted
by a weapon is of a particularly type that
may bypass certain resistances the target
normally possesses. The use of this call is at
the discretion of the user, and may be used
once at the start of a combat, or multiple
times to remind the target of the weapons
nature.
The damage works by converting the
kinetic energy of the weapon into the
special damage. This means a weapon that
does 1 HP mundane damage would do 1
HP of the special damage instead.
ARCANE (Modifier) Instant Effect
Arcane damage.
SILVER (Modifier) Instant Effect
Silver damage.
HOLY (Modifier) Instant Effect
Holy damage (a form of celestial fire).
FIRE (Modifier) Instant Effect
Fire damage.
SHOCK (Modifier) Instant Effect
Electrical damage.
OUT-OF-CHARACTER CALLS
INVALID (Instant)
An indication to let another player/crewperson know that a particular
effect does not work in the way they think it does, and that they have
not expended its use.
STATUS (Instant)
Target should give an indication as to their condition - Healthy,
Wounded (about half health), Near-death, and at their discretion
additional information that might not be obvious to the player but
would be to their character. If a target thinks they are being targeted
with the STATUS call too often, then they are allowed to ignore the extra
STATUS calls.
TIME-OUT (Indefinite)
The safety call for when Out-of-Character
a player or NPC has been injured or there
is a substantial safety concern that requires
the game to stop.
All players and NPCs are expected where
possible to go down on one knee where
appropriate and halt any action except
where they are assisting with resolving the
OOC situation.
The converse call of “Time In” is only to
be called by the most senior GM (or PC or
NPC if no GMs are present) and only once
the one who first made the call is satisfied
with the resolution.
