There are two categories of action for the Downtime, one for players, and
a supplementary one for the Faction Commander and their delegates.
The Downtime throughout the Chronicle is divided into 12 Phases, with
2 between each Chapter game.
The island of Avyrnas is divided into territories, and each action is
linked to a territory. Each territory has a terrain type, the possibility of a
notable location, and up to 3 resource sites. It also has a risk factor that
can change over the course of the Chronicle.
Each Phase, a territory will have a Risk Factor assigned - No Risk, Low
Risk, Moderate Risk, or High Risk.
A territory can be uncontrolled, or controlled by a player or NPC
faction. Territories controlled by other factions are automatically one
Risk Factor higher for those not of that faction. Hounds ignore this
increased Risk Factor for territories controlled by other player factions.
PERSONAL ACTIONS
By default, each player has 3 actions during a Downtime Phase, with
a 4th action if they possess the ‘Scout’ ability, and a special additional
action if they possess the ‘Retinue’ ability.
These personal actions should be submitted via the Downtime form on
the website.
A personal action can be one of three things: Explore, Patrol, or Labour.
The default personal action is always Labour at the Faction Stronghold
territory at No Risk.
Explore - 2 territories beyond an already controlled territory. Anyone
can spend 1 action to increase the range of their remaining actions by
one. Those with the ‘Scout’ ability automatically get +1 range.
Patrol - Increase Military Strength of a controlled territory. Enough
people also causes surrounding territories to be affected. The effect lasts
for two Phases.
Labour - Increase Faction Resource yield from a controlled territory.
Gain additional personal resources.
Each personal action results in an Encounter Challenge, the nature of
which is determined by random rolls made by the GM team at the end
of each Downtime Phase, modified by the Risk Factor and character
specific modifiers, including the ‘Scout’ ability, Wits 4, and Fated effects.
Success, failure, or a marginal pass on an Encounter Challenge is
determined by comparing the cumulative Combat, Arcane or Skillful
Prowess of the character with the level set by the challenge.
The result of an Encounter Challenge will be displayed as the type of
encounter (i.e. ‘Cultists’, or ‘Locked Chest’), the outcome (succeed, pass,
or fail), and what you gained out of it (i.e. gold, injuries, information). It
is up to the player to then, if they so wish, to craft the story of how that
encounter played out.
Possible gains or losses out of an encounter include; allies, blessings,
currency, curses, enemies, equipment points, fame/notoriety, gnosis
points, information, injuries, items, special locations and more.
If other members of the player’s faction, or the Hounds faction allocate
the same sort of action to a territory the player has allocated an action
to, the player gains a bonus on their action outcome. The presence of at
least one Hound in the territory means that the backup counts as the
next level.
The presence of a warband from the player faction in a territory that
player is carrying out a personal action in grants a reasonable bonus to
the player’s combat prowess, and minor bonuses to arcane and skillful
prowess.
FACTION COMMAND
The Faction Commander or their delegates have the ability to order
several other types of actions during a Downtime Phase. These actions
can be as extensive as the Faction has resources to carry them out.
These actions should be submitted via the Faction Command form on
the website.
WARMASTER
The Warmaster is in control of the military forces of the Faction, known
as the Faction Troops. These forces are organised into Warbands, each
consisting of 100 soldiers and 200 support personnel.
The Faction Troops can be deployed to territories on the island, to
assault, capture or defend them.
Assault - Deployment to an uncontrolled territory up to 2 territories
away from one that is already controlled by the faction. They gain a
bonus to Military Strength for any battle they fight in that territory, but
cannot capture the territory.
Capture - Deployment to an uncontrolled territory adjoining one that
is already controlled by the faction. If undefended or if they successfully
defeat any opposition, the territory is claimed by the faction
Defend - Deployment to a territory already controlled by the faction.
A warband can be either Fresh, Worn, Weary or Broken, with a base
effective Military Strength of 100, 75, 50 or 25 respectively. Improved
Weapons & Armour and various other enhancements can increase a
warband’s Military Strength.
The presence of player characters from the Warmaster’s faction in a
territory to which Faction Troops have been allocated, increases their
effective Military Strength. If there is at least one Hound in the territory,
the backup counts as the next level.
Each Downtime Phase, the Warmaster is expected to set the Conflict
Stance between their faction and the other factions. These can be Hostile,
Neutral or Allied. The default stance towards other player factions is
Neutral, and to NPC factions it is Hostile.
If the warbands from two or more factions are deployed to the same
territory during a Downtime Phase, there are several outcomes.
Hostile & Hostile - Battle ensues between the warbands.
Hostile & Neutral/Allied - Battle ensues between the warbands, with
the Neutral forces at a disadvantage.
Neutral/Allied & Neutral/Allied - Territory is contested and though
no battle ensues it cannot be claimed by either faction.
If a territory is already held by a faction, a warband from another faction
that enters it results in several outcomes based on their faction stance.
Hostile - Battle ensues
Neutral - If the other faction is Allied, nothing happens. If it is Neutral
the territory becomes contested. If Hostile, battle ensues with the
Neutral forces at a disadvantage.
Allied - If the other faction is Hostile, as above. If Neutral or Allied, the
territory is not contested and both faction forces can support each other
in battle against other factions. Food from the faction that controls the
territory is consumed by the forces of the other faction though.
SPYMASTER
During a Downtime phase, the Spymaster can choose to use their
influence to reveal the orders of Warmasters from other factions before
they are carried out, or conceal the orders of their own Warmaster.
They also stand to gain information about the actions of players from
their own faction and others, though this may sometimes require
expenditure from the Faction Treasury.
31
GOVERNOR
The Governor is in charge of the Faction Resources, and can draw
upon them to further develop the Faction Stronghold and outposts in
controlled territories.

of gaining benefit from development.

PAYMASTER
The Paymaster is in charge of the Faction Treasury, which at the
commencement of the Chronicle consists of 25,000ss. The Treasury can
be used by the Paymaster to outfit Faction players they choose with any
equipment other than the Angels Hair reagent.
At the end of each Downtime Phase, the Treasury will be recalculated
based on income and expenditure dependant on Warmaster, Spymaster
and Governor actions. After commencement of the Chronicle, lesser
and greater environmental reagents cannot be purchased straight off the
equipment list, and must be found in-game or acquired through some
other means.
The Paymaster is responsible for setting how much the Population
earn each Downtime Phase, and how much each player earns. Good
management of the finances will improve the morale of the faction while
preventing the Faction Treasury from running dry.
