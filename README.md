# Crucible Game Guide

The Gamma release of the Crucible Game Guide should be just about everything a participant needs to create a character and engage in the
Chronicle. Additional setting material can be found in the Crucible Codex that will help with working out backstories and the nature of the
greater setting.

Some feedback is still welcome as we polish this document, though we will not be making any major changes to the structure of the ruleset, and
will focus our efforts on streamlining and tweaking existing material.  
Artwork or photography to embed within this document would also be appreciated.

Feedback can be emailed to [thecruciblenzlarps@gmail.com](mailto:thecruciblenzlarps@gmail.com)
