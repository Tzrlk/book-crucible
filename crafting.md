A creative individual with resources at hand can make all manner of
useful and fantastic creations, particularly when magic is brought into
the mix. At its simplest, the combining of mundane materials such as
different types of wood, metal and stone through Crafting can create
items from jewellery to castles, and at its most useful, the blank forms of
magical artefacts. The arcane art of Enchanting, is the process of taking
a blank item and imbuing it with persistent magical power for a set
purpose, using a range of potent ingredients and manipulations.
CRAFTING
A character that possesses the Craftsman skill has the ability to
manufacture a wide range of items as is needed by their faction, and
by other players in particular. While much of this is up to roleplaying
and the decision of the crafter (the Gamemaster team is not concerned
about what is required to create a cup or a piece of clothing), a crafter
may be required from time to time to make a special item of relevance
to key events in the Chronicle, or some particular piece of equipment
for another player.
Those with the Craftsman skill also
gain a bonus on the result when trading
in Equipment Points through the
Quartermaster.
Notably, for use in Enchanting, a craftsman
that also possesses the Artisan ability can
also manufacture specially prepared foci
for imbuing with magical energy. These
items are known as Arcane Blanks, and
can take whatever specific form the crafter
chooses, as long as they roughly match
with the theme of the blank.

ENCHANTED ARTEFACTS
Through an intricate process of magically weaving a special spell into
carefully crafted Arcane Blank, an enchanter can create an Enchanted
Artefact that retains the ability to generate a persistent magical effect,
or at least one that can be repeatedly replicated. The creation of
each artefact is a complex process, requiring comprehension of the
enchanting schematic, a selection of appropriate reagents, and the timeconsuming
crafting process itself, especially if the enchanting is best
carried out under the light of a full moon, or while surrounded by the
fires of an active volcano.
Lastly, before each artefact is awoken from its intial dormant state, an
investment of awareness must be imparted by either the enchanter or
a willing chosen individual. This small measure of power activates the
potential of the artefact and allows its use by anyone, though it forever
retains a small link to the individual that awoke it.
Each Enchanted Artefact should ideally be marked with a small purple
tag, sticker or strip of fabric somehow. This marking should have on it
the identification code corresponding to what the item is.
