# Characters

## STARTING CHARACTERS

Each new player starts the Chronicle with 30 Experience Points (XP) to spend on Traits, a Path, and/or Abilities. This total and any additional XP gained through the course of the Chronicle will be carried over in the event of a player choosing to make a new character after an existing one perishes or is retired.

## TRAITS

A character possesses five core traits that form the basis for derived traits like Health and Mana, and determine which abilities they can acquire. These traits are Power, Finesse, Fortitude, Will and Wits. Each character starts with a score of 1 in each trait, and 2 additional points to distribute amongst them as they see fit. The derived traits are calculated as follows:  Health is the character’s Fortitude plus 2, and if they are a Spellcaster, they also possess Mana, which is equal to 2 times their Will.

Any additional points beyond this cost 5 XP. The maximum each of these traits can go to is 4. Additional trait points may be purchased over the course of the Chronicle.

## PATHS

The paths are optional classes of characters with a collection of trait bonuses and discounted abilities appropriate to their theme. A Fighter for instance is able to use almost any weapon or piece of armour they wish, and a Druid is adept at foraging and creating elixirs.

They cost 20 XP each, can only be purchased at Character Creation, and only one can be purchased for each character. Optional skill selections are distinguished by being divided by a ‘/’, and a player may select one of the two for their character. Though any character may possess an ability from a path without meeting the prerequisites, to use any such abilities, the character still need to possess the necessary trait levels as specified by the ability and any prerequisite abilities.
